This program simulates the effects of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism that leads to the Sickle Cell genetic disease.

When given a DNA sequence of arbitrary length, the program identifies and returns the amino acid sequence of the DNA 
using the amino acid SLC code.

There are many different amino acids. This program does the first five Amino Acids (i.e I, L, V, F M) and makes
any other codon be printed as the amino acid 'X'.

The Mutate function reads the contents of the text file named 'DNA.txt'.
It then identifies the first occurrence of the lowercase letter 'a' in 'DNA.txt'.

The file normalDNA.txt has the same DNA sequence as DNA.txt with the 'a' changed to an 'A'.
The file mutatedDNA.txt has the same DNA sequence as DNA.txt with the 'a' changed to a 'T'.
